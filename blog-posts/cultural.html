<h1> Fireside Chat </h1>

</div>

<div id= "body">

<p> I am very thankful for having taken the time to finally watched the fireside chat.  Watching an hour long video seemed like "busy work" to me and certainly given my current time constraints was low on my list of priorites.  However like all the videos I've watch from DBC I was truly inspired by the blunt honesty and compassion expressed by Shereef.  Originally I intended on skimming the video for key points but instead watched it in its entirety and was left feeling inspired and thankful for the opportunity DBC extends to myself and others. I received a much needed boost of inspiration for DBC and the daily challenges in my current life.<br>

	<p> Interestingly before deciding to start the journey that is DBC 
I like most people read various reviews and reports both positive and negative regarding their experience.  One critisim was how people devote months of their life and at least 15000 and are not assured a job in the field.  One rebuttal was imagining applying these same standards to most colleges. Instead of 15,000 and 3 months of time you are commiting at least four years and 100,000 or more while likely getting little assistance of getting a job in your field and a much lower success rate at doing so.  The focus on emotional intelligence and the ability to work with others while overcoming adversity and adapting to an ever changing environment is what I believe to be a key part of that success. <br><p></p>
</p>

	<p> I am a little apprehensive of the DBC environemnt but excited at the challenges it presents at mutliple levels.  I feel i learn best on my own hashing it out and and coming to my own conclusions.  A true characterisitc of an introvert.  However we live in a primarily extroverted world and being forced out of that comfort zone I know from experience will create success.
