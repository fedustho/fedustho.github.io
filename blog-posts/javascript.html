	<p>    Javascript was created in 1995 by an individual working with Netscape named Brendan Eich.  It was called Livescript originally and later changed to the name Javascript to elude to the popularity of the java programming language. Javascript makes interaction with the user quicker and more interactive due to running in the users browser rather than remotely.  It is also currently the only language that all commonly used browsers support.
		<p></p>
		Javascript also has its downsided. Due to running in the user's browser it is more susceptable to malicous code.  Javascript's  ability to run outside the web browser can make it an even greater secuity threat overall.  It is also classified as a loosely typed language making bugs more frequent and more diffiult to discover inititially.
		Although Javascipt sounds similar to Java and both have a syntax similar to the programming language C, other than the name the differences outnumber the similarities overall.
