	<div id = "ghost">

	<p>Ive always been a big fan of ghost stories and horror fiction/movies. I enjoy this as it claims true stories and photos. Its called <span style="color: red">yourghoststories.com</span>.  From an aesthetic point of view I enjoy the flow and visual simplicity.</p>
	<p>Click the apparition to enter and you decide.</p>

			<div id="google">
				<p><span style="color:blue">Google.com</span> may seem like an obvious and boring choice but I appreciate that it does not assualt the viewer with images and ads and instead presents a simple and creative daily theme. Its a gateway to another place and where it leads you is up to you.</p>

			<div id="arizona">
				<p><span style="color: #088A08">Arizonahikingtrails.com</span> is another favorite of mine for similar reasons to the other two mentioned. Great content and a user freindly design. In this example simple is simply better. Click the picture below for some great hiking adventures in Arizona.</p>
