<h1>My thinking style and DBC</h1>

<p>The characteristics described in my learning style of abstract sequential have proven to be true in many ways and at the same time have presented challenges.  After rereading the description I had to laugh as certain points 
explained my struggles.  One of which is having time to deal with the subject thoroughly.  I am 
tending to obsess and over analyze too much in the beginning of a unit and use up my time then have to try to hurry
through other parts.  I've gotten to a point where I just force myself to begin an exercise rather than waiting until I feel like I really know what Im doing and work it out as I go along. That way Im not spending a lot of time on tangents that end up not making a difference.

Growth VS fixed mindset I believe is a good concept for people to revisit throughtout their lives periodically.  As a person gets older I believe people tend to fall more into a fixed mindest. They have years of interpreting their world and have created definitions and categries that work for them but may not be very accurate overall. The learning aspect of a growth mindset reminds me of a book by a chess professional and programmer who wrote that he was puzzled when people assumed he was really smart becuase he was good at chess and programming. He said the reality was that he just had a lot of free time and if given enough time and interest anyone could learn what he knew regarding chess and programming. In DBC I am learning to focus on what I can do and what I am able to achieve rather than focusing at the end of a unit on and excercise that may have been particulary difficult or a subject I struggled to truly understand. These are challenges I need to revist at a later time but need to keep moving forward.
