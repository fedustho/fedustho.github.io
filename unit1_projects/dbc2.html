	<h1><strong>LOST IN THE WILDERNESS</strong></h1>
	
<h2>First things to consider</h2>
<div>
	<p>First thing to consider when entering the wilderness is how to avoid getting lost. Bring trail maps and a compass and keep a mental note of landmarks. Dont venture of trails any more than needed as it damages your natural surroundings and losing site of the trail could be something you soon regret.</p>
</div>	
<h3>You are lost. Now what?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>You have journeyed off the trail in an unfamiliar territory. When going back to where you thought you left off the trail is not there. You begin to doubt your memory of events and you mental landmarks no longer make sense. The trees and rocks begin to look the same and further attempts to get back to a familiar area just leave you feeling more hopeless and confused. Whats next?
		</div>

			<ol>
				<li><strong> Stay where you are</strong><br>
					The first instinct is to keep searching for a familiar area and a way out of the situation. This will typcially make matters worse and much harder for someone to find you. Familiarize yourself with your immediate area which is now your center point.</li>
				<li><strong>Find some type of shelter</strong><br>If possible find or construct some type of shelter to help guard you from the elements. Even if its not needed now you dont want to wait unti matters are worse.</li>
				<li><strong>Start a fire</strong><br>Once again if possible. A fire is crucial for staying warm and purifying water</li>
				<li><strong>Find water</strong><br>Find a  water source and purify it if you can.  If not drink it anyway if needed. Dont drive ourself to dehydration in an effort to conserve.</li>
				<li><strong>Do not eat any mushrooms or berries</strong><br>Its better to be hungry than dead in most cases. Eat non-stinging insects like grasshoppers. Cook them if at all possible. Fish is ideal if an option.</li>
				</ol>
