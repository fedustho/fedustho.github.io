My favorite Three Sites

<Body>
<h1>My three favorite sites.</h1>
<div>
<p>I had never given it much thought but I like simplicity is what I like most in a website. The contect is more of an attraction to me and the design should complement and not hinder navigating through the content.</p>
</div>


<ol>Three favorite Wesites</ol>
<li>Google.com</li>
<p> Seems like a boring and obvious choice but the simplicty of the appearance and interface with a clean white background does not distract from finding the powerful tools within.</p>
<li>Arizonahiking trails.com</li>
<p>Other than the fact I live in Arizona and love hiking the design for similar reason to Google. Clean background with a simple unlcuttered menu with links only when needed. </p>
<li>pc gamer.com</li>
<p> Although much busier and cluttered than the two mentioned above it does a good job at putting most relevant information in front and drwaing the viewer in as needed. I seldom find myself having to dig and search for any content for long.</p>
