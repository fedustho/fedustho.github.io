	<h1>Margins Borders Padding</h1>

<div id = "body">
<p>Margins, Borders, and padding.  What are they? Different names for the same thing? Why would one be used and another not in a given situation? Its a simple idea thats easily confused when first learning to use HTML. The explanations are often written for someone with experience in HTML and therefore leave more questions then answers  Here is a simple and non-technical explanaion of the exact uses and purpose of these three very simple yet visually powerful tools.</p>	
</div>

<div id = "margins">
	Margins seperate the "block" from its surroundings. Like the block above for example where I wrote the title.  Your not directly seeing the margin, your seeing the space around the block created by the margin. A "buffer zone" so to speak from the margin to the rest of the page.
</p>
</div>

<div id = "borders">
</p>
	A border is the color that your seeing in the same block.  I made it blue to keep things simple and easy to understand but there are an endless about of colors and style combinations you can do.  Get creative or keep it simple but the best way to learn is to experiment.
</p>
</div>	

<div id = "padding">
	<p>Padding is the other mysterious force your indirectly seeing on the inside of the blue border. It "pads" the content in the container from the border. 
	</p> 

<div id = "end">
	<p> Simple right?  It actually is very simple. Ill post the code of the box at the top of the screen.  All three can have top, bottom, left, and right attributes.  You can give them seperate values or make them all the same.  It will take some playing to get what your looking for but start simple and work your way up from there and you will soon master the art of margins, borders, and padding.<br>
